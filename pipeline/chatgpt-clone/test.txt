Diary Entry – Asset Allocation & Expenses
========================================

Nov 5, 2025

Woke up thinking about my portfolio again. Markets have been choppy, but I'm mostly sticking to my plan. Here's where things stand today:

Stocks
------
- ETHD (ETL): 192 shares @ $3.60 avg. Up about 18%. Tempted to trim if it goes above $200, but for now, holding tight.
- Apple (APPL): 2750.008299 shares @ $164.650 avg. Still my core tech holding. No plans to touch it unless something big changes.

International
-------------
- Toyota (TM): 40 shares @ $134.75. Just a small position for some global flavor.
- Nestlé (NSRGY): 120 shares @ $113.20. Steady dividends, reinvesting as usual.
- Rigetti : 6 shares @ $36.42. Just a small position for som global flavor.
- HD : 1 shares @ $26. Just a small position for som global flavor.

Growth/Small Cap
----------------
- IONQ : 4 shares @ $61.81. Still underwater here. Need to check Q3 earnings before making any moves.
- meta : 2.52 shares @ $652.82. Down, but showing some signs of life. Watching for a breakout above $80.

Passive/Core
------------
- VTI: 600 units @ $212.90. The backbone of my portfolio.
- EEM: 450 units @ $38.40. Emerging markets are lagging, but I'm patient.

Bonds & Cash
------------
- $45k in 2-year Treasuries (4.84% coupon).
- $18k in IG corporates, laddered 2026-2029. Avg YTM ~4.6%.
- $23,700 in a 5.05% money market fund. About 7% of my portfolio, ready for opportunities.

Alternatives
------------
- Prologis (PLD): 280 shares @ $116.00. REIT for some real asset exposure.
- Gold: 5 oz, cost basis $1,745/oz. Feels good to have a little insurance.
- Bitcoin: 2.3 BTC, blended cost $29,300. Capping this at 3% of net worth for now.

Portfolio value: ~$840k. Target: 60% equities, 25% bonds, 10% alts, 5% cash. 3-year annualized return: 9.2%. Beta vs S&P 500: 0.93.

Action items: Rebalance if equities >65% or cash <5%. Watch small caps after earnings. Decide on AAPL/MSFT trim by next quarter.

Expense Tracking
================

- Coffee at Blue Bottle: $5.25 (treat for myself after a long week)
- Groceries (Trader Joe's): $74.80 (stocked up on veggies and snacks)
- Monthly rent paid: $2,150 (wish this was lower, but location is worth it)
- Gym membership: $49 (need to go more often!)
- Dinner with friends: $38.60 (Korean BBQ, totally worth it)
- Uber to work: $17.40 (rainy morning, didn't want to bike)
- Streaming subscriptions: $27.99 (Netflix + Spotify)
- Book purchase: $14.99 (finally got that investing book I wanted)
- Phone bill: $62.00 (should look for a cheaper plan)
- Miscellaneous: $23.50 (random Amazon stuff)

Reflection: Spent a bit more than usual this week, but most of it felt justified. Need to keep an eye on those little Amazon purchases—they add up! Overall, feeling good about my financial discipline, but always room to improve.
